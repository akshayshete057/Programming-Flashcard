{"question":"Describe Functions?","answer":"A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C++ program contains a main() function."},
{"question":"What are pointers?","answer":"A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable. When &amp; preceeds a variable name, it describes its address. For example : var is a variable, then &amp;var will return its address. When we store this address in a new variable, the new variable will hold the address of another variable, and it will be called a Pointer."},
{"question":"Explain Reference variable?","answer":"Reference variable provides a different name (alias) for an already defined variable."},
{"question":"Functions malloc() and calloc() are used for?","answer":"<code>malloc()</code> and <code>calloc()</code> functions are used to allocate memory dynamically at run time, and similarly function free() is used to free dynamically allocated memory. "},
{"question":"What is Operator overloading?","answer":"Overloading means assigning different meaning to different meanings to an operation. C++ permits overloading of operations. "},
{"question":"What are functions?","answer":"A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C++ program contains a main() function. "},
{"question":"What is Function prototyping?","answer":"Function prototyping is one of the major feature of C++ which is not in C. Function prototyping, a template is always used to define and declare a function. "},
{"question":"What do you mean by Call by Reference?","answer":"By call by reference method means arguments to a function copies the reference of an argument into formal parameter. The reference is used to access the actual argument used in the call."},
{"question":"What do mean by Call by value?","answer":"Copying of the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function is called call by value.  Changes done to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument."},
{"question":"What is Inline function?","answer":"Inline function is a concept that is commonly used with classes. If the function is inline, then the compiler places a copy of the code of that function at each point where the function is called at compile time."},
{"question":"What is a default argument?","answer":"In C++ we can call a function without specifying all its arguments. In this case the function assigns a default value to the parameter which does not have a matching arguments in the function call. Values are specified at the time the function call."},
{"question":"What are const arguments?","answer":"The const qualifier tells the compiler that the function should not modify the argument. Compiler generates an error if this condition is violated. Declaration of this type of argument is significant only when we pass arguments by reference or pointers."},
{"question":"What is the difference between a structure and a class in C++?","answer":"There is only one main difference between a structure and a class in C++ it is that the members of a class are private by default and by default the members of a structure are public."},

{"question":"What are static data members?","answer":"A data member can be declared as static. Static member is initialized to zero when the first object of its class is created. No other initialization is permitted. One copy of that member is created for the entire class and is shared by all objects of that class. It is only visible within the class."},
{"question":"What are static member functions?","answer":"The static member functions are similar to static data variables. The static member functions have the following properties:<div><ol><li>A static member function can only access other static members.</li><li>A static member function can be called using the class name.</li></ol></div>"},

{"question":"What do you mean by copy constructor?","answer":"A copy constructor is used to declare and initialize an object from another object. Copy constructor takes a reference to an object of the same class as itself as an argument."},
{"question":"When are copy constructors called?","answer":"Copy constructors are called in following cases :<div>1. When a function returns an object of that class by value.</div><div>2. When the object of that class is passed by value as an argument to a function.</div><div>3. When you construct an object based on another object of the same class.</div><div>4. When compiler generates a temporary object.</div>"},
{"question":"Can a copy constructor accept an object of the same class as parameter, instead of reference of the object?","answer":"No. It is specified in the definition of the copy constructor itself. It should generate an error if a programmer specifies a copy constructor with a first argument that is an object and not a reference."},
{"question":"Is it possible to have Virtual Constructor? If yes, how? If not, Why not possible?","answer":"There is nothing like Virtual Constructor. The Constructor can’t be virtual as the constructor is a code which is responsible for creating an instance of a class and it can’t be delegated to any other object by virtual keyword means"},
{"question":"What are Virtual Destructor?","answer":"A destructor can be virtual as it is possible at runtime depending on the type of object caller is calling to, proper destructor will be called."},
{"question":"What is the difference between a copy constructor and an overloaded assignment operator?","answer":"A copy constructor constructs a new object by using the content of the argument object. An overloaded assignment operator assigns the contents of an existing object to another existing object of the same class."},
{"question":"Can a constructor throw an exception?","answer":"The constructor never throws an error."},
{"question":"What is default constructor?","answer":"Constructor with no arguments or all the arguments has default values."},
{"question":"What is conversion constructor?","answer":"In a class, a Constructor with a single argument makes that constructor as conversion constructor as it can be used for type conversion. That means such a constructor allows automatic conversion to the class being constructed."},
{"question":"How can I handle a constructor that fails?","answer":"You can throw an exception. Constructors don't have a return type, so it's not possible to use return codes. The best way to signal constructor failure is therefore to throw an exception."},
{"question":"What is Stack unwinding?","answer":"When an exception occurs, all the local objects created while execution are destroyed in the reverse order, this mechanism is called stack unwinding. During stack unwinding destructors of all these local objects are called, and then the catch block is executed."},
{"question":"What's the order that local objects are destructed?","answer":"In reverse order of construction: First constructed, last destructed."},
{"question":"Can the destructor for a class be overloaded?","answer":"<b>No</b>, There is only one destructor for a class. Destructors never take any parameters and never returns anything. You can not pass any parameter to a destructor as you never call it explicitly."},
{"question":"Can we explicitly call a destructor on a local variable?","answer":"Yes, we can. But we should never do so.<div>The destructor will get called again at the close } of the block in which the local was created. This is a guarantee of the language, it happens automagically, there's no way to stop it from happening. But you can get really bad results from calling a destructor on the same object a second time.</div>"},
{"question":"How can we destroy a local object explicitly before the end?","answer":"By Simply wrapping up the extent of the lifetime of the local object in an artificial block.<code>some block { create object here }</code>"},
{"question":"What is Inheritance?","answer":": Inheritance allows one class to reuse the state and behavior of another class. The derived class inherits the properties and method implementations of the base class and extends it by overriding methods and adding additional properties and methods."},
{"question":"What is Multiple Inheritance(virtual inheritance)? What are its Advantages and Disadvantages?","answer":"Multiple Inheritance is the process whereby a child can be derived from more than one parent class. The advantage of multiple inheritance is that it allows a class to inherit the functionality of more than one base class thus allowing for modeling of complex relationships.<p>The disadvantage of multiple inheritance is that it can lead to a lot of confusion(ambiguity) when two base classes implement a method with the same name.</p>"},

This thread pool is usually pre-allocated before the boss (or master) begins dispatching threads to work. Although threads are lightweight, they still incur overhead when they are created. If the boss thread becomes a worker thread once it's done starting other worker threads then this is a Peer Thread Design Pattern."},
{"question":"Define: Critical Section in Multithreading in C++","answer":"Its the code between lock and unlock calls to a mutex."},
{"question":"What are four mutex types?","answer":"Recursive: allows a thread holding the lock to acquire the same lock again which may be necessary for recursive algorithms. Queuing: allows for fairness in lock acquisition by providing FIFO ordering to the arrival of lock requests. Such mutexes may be slower due to increased overhead and the possibility of having to wake threads next in line that may be sleeping. Reader/Writer: allows for multiple readers to acquire the lock simultaneously. If existing readers have the lock, a writer request on the lock will block until all readers have given up the lock. This can lead to writer starvation. Scoped: RAII-style semantics regarding lock acquisition and unlocking."},
{"question":"What is Deadlock?","answer":"Two (or more) threads have stopped execution or are spinning permanently. For example, a simple deadlock situation: thread 1 locks lock A, thread 2 locks lock B, thread 1 wants lock B and thread 2 wants lock A."},
{"question":"How can you prevent deadlocking from occurring?","answer":"You can prevent deadlocks from happening by making sure threads acquire locks in an agreed order (i.e. preservation of lock ordering). Deadlock can also happen if threads do not unlock mutexes properly."},
{"question":"Define : Race Condition","answer":"A race condition is when non-deterministic behavior results from threads accessing shared data or resources without following a defined synchronization protocol for serializing such access."},
{"question":"How can you prevent Race Conditions from occurring?","answer":"Take steps within your program to enforce serial access to shared file descriptors and other external resources."},
{"question":"Define : Priority Inversion","answer":"A higher priority thread can wait behind a lower priority thread if the lower priority thread holds a lock for which the higher priority thread is waiting. In such a case its called priority inversion, as the higher priority thread has no other option, but wait."},
{"question":"Define: Condition Variables","answer":"Condition variables allow threads to synchronize to a value of a shared resource. Typically, condition variables are used as a notification system between threads. In Java wait() and notify() are used."},
{"question":"Define: (Thread) Barriers","answer":"Barriers are a method to synchronize a set of threads at some point in time by having all participating threads in the barrier wait until all threads have called the said barrier function. This, in essence, blocks all threads participating in the barrier until the slowest participating thread reaches the barrier call."},
{"question":"Define: Semaphores","answer":"Semaphores are another type of synchronization primitive that come in two flavors: binary and counting. Binary semaphores act much like simple mutexes, while counting semaphores can behave as recursive mutexes. Counting semaphores can be initialized to any arbitrary value which should depend on how many resources you have available for that particular shared data. Many threads can obtain the lock simultaneously until the limit is reached. This is referred to as lock depth."},
{"question":"Define: Spinlocks","answer":"Spinlocks are locks which spin on mutexes. Spinning refers to continuously polling until a condition has been met. In the case of spinlocks, if a thread cannot obtain the mutex, it will keep polling the lock until it is free. The advantage of a spinlock is that the thread is kept active and does not enter a sleep-wait for a mutex to become available, thus can perform better in certain cases than typical blocking-sleep-wait style mutexes. Mutexes which are heavily contended are poor candidates for spinlocks. "},
{"question":"List six Synchronization primitives used in Multithreading.","answer":"Mutex, Join, Condition Variables, Barriers, Spin Loack and Semaphores."},
{"question":"Define: Livelock","answer":"A livelock is similar to a deadlock, except that the states of the processes involved in the livelock constantly change with regard to one another, none progressing."},
{"question":"What does the term 'lock-free' mean?","answer":"Multithreaded code written such that the threads can never permanently lock up."},
{"question":"Define: 'Busy waiting' and how it can be avoided?","answer":"When one thread is waiting for another thread using an active looping structure that doesn't do anything. This can be avoided using mutexes."}
